************DISCUSSION****************
1. Pick an example of an interesting real-world object and describe it as a
programming object by listing its data (attributes, what it "knows") and
its methods (behaviors, what it can "do").
2. Describe in your own words the object produced by each of the following
operations from the graphics module. Be as precise as you can. Be sure to
mention such things as the size, position, and appearance of the various
objects. You may include a sketch if that helps.
a) Point ( 130 , 1 30)
b) c = Circle (Point ( 30 , 40) , 25)
c . setFill ( " blue " )
c . setOutline ( " red " )
c) r = Rectangle (Po int ( 20 , 20) , Point (40 , 40) )
r . setFill ( color_rgb (0 , 255 , 150) )
r . setWidth (3)
d) 1 = Line (Point ( 100 , 100) , Point ( 100 , 200) )
l . set0utline ( " red4 " )
l . setArrow ( '' f irst '' )
e) Oval (Point (50 , 50) , Point ( 60 , 100) )
125
f ) shape = Polygon (Point (5 , 5 ) , Point ( 10 , 10) , Point (5 , 10) , Point ( 10 , 5) )
shape . setFill ( " orange " )
g) t = Text (Po int ( 100 , 100) , " Hello World ! " )
t . setFace ( " courier " )
t . setS ize ( 16 )
t . setStyle ( '' ital i c '' )
3. Describe what happens when the following interactive graphics program
runs:
from graphics import *
def main ( ) :
win = GraphWin ( )
shape = Circle (Point (50 , 50) , 20)
shape . setOut l ine ( " red " )
shape . setFill ( " red" )
shape . draw (win)
f or i in range ( 10) :
p = win . getMouse ( )
c = shape . getCenter ( )
dx = p . getX ( ) - c . getX ( )
dy = p . getY ( ) - c . getY ( )
shape . move (dx , dy)
win . close ( )
main ( )
