6.Using the example from pages 64 and 65 of the book, change and 
enter the code below  so that you ask the user for the number of 
$1 bills, 5$ bills, $10 bills, and $20 bills they have in their wallet. 
then print out how much money they have.  
I have given you a sample of  first part of the code below...
You must enter a complete python program in order to get credit. 
I plan to just cut/paste your solution into IDLE to validate that it works. 

def main():
    print("Dollar Counter")
    print()
    print("please enter the count for each of the denominations you have.")

< YOUR CODE GOES HERE> 



def main():
    print("Dollar Counter")
    print()
    print("Please enter the count for each of the denominations you have.")

    print()

    print()


    dollar = int(input("How many $1 bills do you have?: ")) 
    dollar_fives = int(input("How many $5 bills do you have?: "))
    dollar_tens = int(input("How many $10 bills do you have?: "))
    dollar_twenty = int(input("How many $20 bills do you have?: "))

print()
    print("You have a total of $", dollar + dollar_fives*5 + 
	dollar_tens*10 + dollar_twenty*20, "dollars")
    print("Big ballin")
main()
