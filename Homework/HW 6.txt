1. Information can be passed to a function via parameters
T 

2. programmers usually create their own functions when writing a program.
T

3. You can call a function from multiple locations in your program.
T

4. Python functions never modify a parameter. 
F


5. Variable defined in a function are scoped to that function. 
T

6.How do you determine which actual parameter to assign to each formal parameter?
The names of the formal parameters must match

the order of the parameters indicate how they are assigned - x

You can only pass in one parameter so it is easy.

you manually assign each parameter at the start of the function.


7. When does the value of an actual parameter of a function change?
Whenever the parameter is a mutable type - X - Wrong 

Only when the parameter is a mutable type and you assign a new value to the formal parameter 
(i.e., the parameter is a list and you assign it to a new list such as x = [2, 3, 4]).

Only when the parameter is a mutable type and you mutate the formal parameter - Correct
(i.e., append an item to a list or change the value of an item in the list such as x[0] = 4).

Any change to a formal parameter affects the corresponding actual parameter.


8.What is the purpose of the return statement in a function definition?

To cause execution of the function to end and return to the code that called it.

To send a value or values back to the code that called it.

A or B - X

none of the above


9. When a function returns a value, usually you want to
ignore the returned value

store the result in a variable or use the result in an expression - X


10. What variable names does a function have access to?

All variables used in a program.

Only variables created in that function

Only parameters passed into the function

parameters that are passed into the function and any variables created in the function - X
