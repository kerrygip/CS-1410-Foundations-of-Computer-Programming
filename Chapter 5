  - True

5. Python lists are mutable, but strings are not.
  - True
  
6. ASCII is a standard for representing characters using numeric codes.
  - False. It is a standard for the US, not everywhere else
  
7. The split method breaks a string into a list of substrings, and join does
the opposite.
  - True
8. A substitution cipher is a good way to keep sensitive information secure.
  - False - it is a simple program that uses a very weak form of encryption

**********DISCUSSION****************
1. Given s1 = "spam"
s2 = "ni!"

Show the results
  a) " The Knights who say , " + s2  = The knights who say ni!
  b) 3 * s1 + 2 * s2 = spamspamspamni!ni!
  c) s1 [1] = p
  d) s1 [ 1 : 3] = pa
  e) s1 [2] + s2 [ : 2] = ani
  f) s1 + s2 [ -1] = spam!
  g) s1.upper() = SPAM
  h) s2.upper().ljust (4) * 3 = NI! NI! NI!
  
  
2. Given the same initial statements, write the expression that would produce these reults
  a) "NI" = s2.upper()
  b) "ni!spamni!" = s2 + s1+ s2
  c) "Spam Ni! Spam Ni! Spam Ni!" = (s1.capitalize() + " " +  s2.capitalize() + " ") * 3
  d) "spam" = s1
  e) ["sp " ,"m"] = "[" + s1[0:2] + "," + s1[-1] + "]"
  f) "spm" = s1[:2] + s1[-1]
  
  
3. Show the output
  a) for ch in " aardvark" :
      print (ch)
       = aardvark one letter at a time going down
  b) for w in " Now is the winter of our discontent . . . " . split():
      print (w)
       = prints the statement one word at a time going down
  c) for w in "Mississippi " .split("i"):
      print (w , end= " " )
      =M ss ss pp
  d) msg = " "
     for s in "secret".split("e"):
        msg = msg + s
     print (msg)
      = scrt
       
  e) msg = " "
    for ch in " secret " :
    msg = msg + chr (ord ( ch) + 1 )
    print (msg)
    =!tfdsfu!  
    
    

4. Show the string that would result from each of the following string formatting
operations. If the operation is not legal, explain why.
171
a) " Looks l ike {1} and {0} for breakfast " . format ( " eggs " , " spam" )
b) " There is {0} {1} {2} {3}" . format ( ! , " spam" , 4 , " you" )
c) "Hello {0} " . format ( " Susan" , " Computewell " )
d) " {0 : 0 . 2f} {0 : 0 . 2f}" . format (2 . 3 , 2 . 3468)
e) " {7 . 5f} {7 . 5f} " . format (2 . 3 , 2 . 3468)
f ) "Time left {0 : 02} : {1 : 05 . 2f } " . format ( 1 , 37 . 374)
g) " {1 : 3} " . format ( " 14" )


5. Explain why public key encryption is more useful for securing communications on the Internet than private (shared) key encryption.

Private key - the same key is the same key used for encrypting and decrypting and only usable by the same party. Party must keep it secret from outside world
Public key - separate but related keys for encrypting and decrypting. Knowing encryption key does not allow you to decrypt. 
    -Anyone can send a message for encryption, only the party holding decryption key can decipher it
