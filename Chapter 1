T/F

1. Computer Science is the study of computers
  - F: Computers are a tool of CS

2. The CPU is the "brain" of the computer
  - T. All basic operations are carried out here
  
 3. Secondary memory is also called RAM
  - F: RAM is accessed by CPU and is the MAIN memory. Fast and volatile. Secondary memory would be DVDs and USBs
  
 4. All the memory that the computer is currently working on is stored in its main memory
  - F. CPU
  
5 . The Syntax of a language is its meaning and its semantic is its form
  - T.
 
6. A function definition is a sequence of statements that defines a new command. 
  - T 

7. A programming environment refers to a place where programmers work
  - T like in Mac, Windows, Linux

8. A variable is used to give a name to a value so it can be referred to in other places 
  - T
  
9.  A loop is used to skip over a section of a program
  - F a loop is used to repeat the same action within certain conditions

10. A chaotic function can't be computed by a computer
  - T very small changes can lead to large changes in the results, so it places limits in the powers of computing

****** Multiple Choice. *******

1. What is the fundamental question of computer science?
  - B. What can be computed
  
2.  An algorithm is like a 
  - D. Recipe
  
3. A problem is intracable when
  - D. it is not practical to solve
  
4. Which of the following is not an example of secondary memory?
  - A Ram is primary memory

5. Computer languages designed and to be used by humans are 
  - B High level computer languages
  
6. A Statement is
  B A complete computer command
  
7. A compiler is
  - B used to translate high level language into machine language
  
8. By convetion, the statements of a program are often placed in a function called
  - B main
  
9. Which is the following not true of comments?
  - A. They do make a program more efficient
  
10. The items listed in the parenthesis of a function are called 
  - D. Parameters(B) and Arguments(C) - D - both B and C are correct
  

***DISCUSSION******

1. Compare and contract the following pair of concepts from the chapter
  a. Hardware vs Software
    Hardware is physical
     Software is programmable
     
  b. Algorithm vs program
    algorithm is the steps
    program is the written
    
  c. Programming language vs natural language
    programming langauge is like C++ or python
    natural language is spoken by humans
    
  d. high level language vs machine language
    high level langauge is something easily readable by humans
    machine language is close to binary if not binary
    
  e. interpreter vs compiler
    interpreter is a program that simulates a computer and understands high level language
    compiler is program that takes a program and translates it to machine language
    
  f. syntax vs semantics
    syntax is form
    semantics is grammar
  
2. List and explain in your own words the role of each of the 5 basic functional units of a computer in figure 1.1
      CPU - brain
      Main Memory - where things are stored and worked on
      Input device - Information given in, like mouse/keyboard click
      Output device - Information that needs to be displayed
      Secondary Memory - permanent storage

3. Write an algorithm for making a peanut butter sandwhich 

4. Can you think of examples where you need to be cautious of changing values? Like chaotic behavior?
    When working with large data sets 

5. Trace the chaois program from section 1.6 using 0.15 as the input and show the squence of outputs



*****PROGRAMMING EXERCISES*****


1. Type the following commands
  print ("Hello, world! ") = Hello, world! 
  print("Hello", "world!") = Helloworld!
  print (3) = 3
  print(3.0) = 3.0
  print (2 + 3) = 5
  print(2. 0 + 3. 0) = 5.0 
  print ("2" +"3")  = 23
  print ( "2 + 3 =", 2 + 3) = 2 + 3 =5 
  print(2 * 3)  =6
  print (2 ** 3)  = 8
  print (7 / 3) = 2.33333333
  print(7// 3) = 2
  
  
2. Enter and run the chaos program from section 1.6. Try it out with various values of input to see that it functions as described in the chapter


3. Modify the chaos program using 2.0 in place of 3.9 as the multiplier in the logistic function. Your modified line of code should look like
  x = 2.0 * x *1(-x)
  Run the program for various input values and compare the results to those obtained from the original program. Write a short paragraph describing any differences
  
  
4. Modify the chaos program so that it prints out 20 values instead of 10

5. Modify chaos program so that number of values to print is determined by the user. You have to add a line at the top of the program. 
n = eval(input("How many numbers should I print? ")

6. The calculation performed in the chaos program can be written in a number of ways that are equivalent. 
Write a version of the program for each of the following ways of doing the computation
Have your program print out 100 iterations of the calculation and compare the results

  a. 3.9 * x * (1-x)
  b. 3.9 * (x-x*x)
  c. 3.9 * x - 3.9 * x * x
  
7. Modify the chaos program so that it accepts two inputs and then prints a table with two columns similar to the one shown in 1.8
