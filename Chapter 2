 ***DISCUSSION***
 1. List and describe in your own words the 6 setps in software development
 Analyze the problem
 Determine the specifications - what will it accomplish
 Create a design
 Implement the Design
 Test/Debug
 Maintain the program
 
 2. Write out the chaos program in 1.6 and identify parts of the program
  - circle each identifier
  - underline the expressions
  - put a comment at the end describing the kind of statements used(output, assignment, input, loop)
  
  3. Explain the relationships on
    Definite Loop - will run a certain number of times
    For Loop - makes it easier to do a counted loop
    Counted Loop - counts how many times it will run, ie in range. 
    
4. What is the output for   
      a. i in range(5):
          print(i*i)
      b. d in [3,1,4,1,5]:
        print (d, end="")
      c. i in range(4):
        print("Hello")
      d. i in range(5):
        print(i,2**i)
        
 5. Why is it a good idea to write in pseudocode rather than jumping to python code

  print("End")

*******PROGRAMMING EXERCISES*****

1. Convert section 2.2 to print an introduction

2. You can run a program by double clicking the program file. You may discover another usability issue. 
Add an input statement at the end of the program so that it gives the user a chance to read the results. 
  input("Press the <Enter> key to quit")
  
3.  Modify the avg2.py program (2.5.3) to find the average of the 3 exam scores

4. Modify convert.py program (2.2) with a loop so it runs 5 times before quitting. 

5. Modify convert.py(2.2) so that it computers and prints a Celsius table of temperatures and Fahrenheit equivalents every 10 degrees from 0C to 100C.

6. Modify futval.py(2.7) so that the number of years for the investment is also a user input. Change the final message to reflect correct number of years

7.  Modify futval.py to compute total accumulation of your investments. Inputs will be amount investedm interest rate and years invested

8. Modify futval.py to use interest gained at not an APR. The program should prompt user for the yearly rate(rate) 
and the number of times that the interest is compounded each year(period).
To compute the value in 10 years, the program will loop 10 periods and accrus rate/period interest on each iteration

9. Write a program to convert F to C
def main () :
    farenheit = eval (input ("What is the F temperature? ") )
    celcius = farenheit- 32 * 5/9
    print ("The temperature is", celcius, "C.")
    
main ()

10. Write a program to convert Km to miles. (1km = 0.62 miles)

11. Write a program that converts whatever you want. 

12. Write an interactive Python calculator
