********Exercises*****************


T/F
1. Information that is stored and manipulated by computers is called data
  - T
2. Since floating point numbers are accurate, they should be used instead of ints
  - F - you use whatever your data/program needs
3. Operations, like addition and subtraction are defined in the math library
  - F - basic operations do not need math library
4. The number of possible arrangements of i items equal to n!
  - T
5. The sqrt function computs the squirt of a number
  - F - square root 
6. Float data type is identical to the mathematical concept of a real number
  - F represents approximations to real numbers
7. Computers represent numbers using base-2 (binary) representations
  - T
8.A hardware float can represent a larger range of values than a hardware int
  - F- int can grow in size to accomodate the value. Limitation is the hardware itself
  
9. Type conversion functions such as float are a safe alternative to eval for getting a number as user input
  - F- have issues with getting simultaneous inputs
  
10. In puthon, 4+5 gets the same result as 4.0+ 9.0
  - F- you get 9 and 9.0 
  
  
*****************Multiple Choice*********************  
1. Which of the following is not a built in Python data type?
  - C Rational
  
2. Which of the following is not a built in operation?
  - D sqrt
  
3. In order to use functions in the math library, a program must include
  - D Import statement
  
4. The value of 4! is 
  - B - 24
  
5. The most appropriate data type to store pi is 
  - B Float
  
6. The number of distinct values that can be represented using 5 bits is 
  - A 5

7. On a mixed type expression involving ints and floats, Python will convert 
  - D - ints to floats

8. Which of the following is not a python type conversion function?
  - B Round

9. The pattern used to compute factorial is 
  - C Counted Loop

10. In Python, an int value that grows larger than the underlying hardware int
  D. uses more memory
  
  
  ********DISCUSSION************
  1. Show the result of each expression. 
    a. 4.0/10.0 + 3.5*2 = 9.5
    b. 10%4 + 6/2 = 5
    c. abs(4-20//3)**3 = 
    d. sqrt(4.5-5) + 7*3 = 21.5
    e. (3*10) // 3 + (10%3)
    f. 3**3 = 27
    
 2. Translate each of the following expressions into an equivalent Python.
    a. (3+4) * 5
    b.(n * (n-2))/ 2
    c. 4*pi*r**2
    d. sqrt(r*(cos(a)**2) + r*(sin(b)**2)
    e. (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)

 3. Show the sequence of numbers that would be generated by the range
    a. range(5) = 0,1,2,3,4
    b. range(3,10) = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9
    c. range(4,13,3) = 4, 7, 10
    d. range(15,5,-2) = 15,13,11,9,7
    e. range (5,3) = 5,4
    
 4. Show the output
    a. for i in rage (1,11):
      print (i*i)
        10!
    b. for i in [1,3,5,7,9]:
      print (i, ":", i**3)
      print (i)
      
    c. x = 2
       y = 10
       for j in range (O, y, x)
       print (j, end="")
       print (x + y)
       print ("done")
       
    d.ans = 0
      for i in range (!, 11) :
      ans = ans + i*i
      print (i)
      print (ans)
    
 5. What will happen if you round(315.159265, -1)? Explain
 6. What do you think will happen to operands if the remainder is negative?
